Flight Finder is a full stack application. The back end was creating using Node.js and mySQL. 

What is the Functionality:

1.) Users can login
2.) A user or employee can be created 
3.) You can search for flights round trip or one way, they must be the exact date
4.) Employers can see a revenew review
5.) Users can purchase tickets and cancel them

This is entirely my project no one else collobrated on it, I contributed its entirety.
